        "explanation": "Cloud fluency is a capability that belongs to the people perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption\nFramework (AWS CAF). Cloud fluency is the ability of the workforce to understand the benefits,\nchallenges, and best practices of cloud computing, and to apply them to their roles and\nresponsibilities. Cloud fluency helps the organization to adopt a cloud mindset, culture, and skills,\nand to leverage the full potential of the cloud. Cloud fluency can be achieved through various\nmethods, such as training, certification, mentoring, coaching, and hands-on experience. Cloud\nfluency is one of the four capabilities of the people perspective, along with culture, organizational\nstructure, and leadership. The other three capabilities belong to different perspectives of the\nAWS CAF. Data architecture is a capability of the platform perspective, which helps you design\nand implement data solutions that meet your business and technical requirements. Event\nmanagement is a capability of the operations perspective, which helps you monitor and respond\nto events that affect the availability, performance, and security of your cloud resources. Strategic\npartnership is a capability of the business perspective, which helps you establish and maintain\nrelationships with external stakeholders, such as customers, partners, suppliers, and regulators,\nto create value and achieve your business goals.References:AWS Cloud Adoption Framework:\nPeople Perspective,AWS CAF - Cloud Adoption Framework - W3Schools\nQuestion 2",

        "explanation": "According to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, AWS is responsible for protecting the\ninfrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud, including Amazon S3. This\ninfrastructure includes hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS services.\nA . Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy: Incorrect, as configuring S3 Lifecycle policies to manage\nobject lifecycle (e.g., transitioning objects to different storage classes or deleting them after a\ncertain period) is the customer's responsibility.\nB . Activate S3 Versioning: Incorrect, as enabling S3 Versioning is a customer responsibility for\nmanaging data protection.\nC . Configure S3 bucket policies: Incorrect, as setting and managing S3 bucket policies to control\naccess is the customer's responsibility.\nAWS Cloud References:\nAWS Shared Responsibility Model\nAmazon S3",

        "explanation": "Understanding S3 Intelligent-Tiering: S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed to optimize costs by\nautomatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier based on changing access\npatterns. It is ideal for data with unknown or unpredictable access patterns.\nWhy S3 Intelligent-Tiering is Cost-Effective:\nAutomatic Tiering: Moves data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent access) based\non changing access patterns, optimizing storage costs without performance impact.\nNo Retrieval Fees: Unlike other storage classes, there are no retrieval fees in Intelligent-Tiering,\nmaking it cost-effective for data with unpredictable access patterns.\nMonitoring and Automation: Automatically monitors access patterns and transitions data,\nreducing the need for manual intervention.\nWhen to Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering:\nUnpredictable Access Patterns: Ideal for datasets where the access frequency cannot be\ndetermined or changes frequently.\nCost Optimization: For organizations looking to minimize storage costs without sacrificing\nperformance or requiring manual intervention to move data between tiers.\nReferences:\nAmazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering",

        "explanation": "By implementing AWS CloudTrail, a company is adhering to the AWS Cloud design principle of\nactivating traceability. AWS CloudTrail provides detailed logs of all API calls made in an AWS\naccount, which helps monitor, troubleshoot, and detect unusual activity, thereby improving\nsecurity and compliance. This supports the principle of 'activating traceability' by enabling\ncontinuous monitoring and auditing of all actions and changes within the AWS environment.\nB . Use serverless compute architectures: Incorrect, as this principle encourages the use of\nmanaged services that handle infrastructure, such as AWS Lambda, and is not directly related to\nCloudTrail.\nC . Perform operations as code: Incorrect, as this principle emphasizes the use of code and\nautomation for infrastructure management.\nD . Go global in minutes: Incorrect, as this principle relates to the global deployment of\napplications and services.\nAWS Cloud References:\nAWS Well-Architected Framework\nAWS CloudTrail",

AWS Cost Explorer is a web-based interface that allows users to\naccess interactive graphs and tables that display their AWS costs and usage data. Users can\ncreate custom reports that analyze cost and usage data by various dimensions, such as service,\nregion, account, tag, and more. Users can also view historical data for up to the last 12 months,\nforecast future costs for up to the next 12 months, and get recommendations for cost\noptimization. AWS Cost Explorer also provides preconfigured views that show common cost and\nusage scenarios, such as monthly spend by service, daily spend by linked account, and Reserved\nInstance utilization.
